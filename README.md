# article-editor

This project is a simple, client-side React component designed to improve text proofreading efficiency. The component displays two text boxes side-by-side: one for the original text and one for the proofread suggestion. Changes between the texts are highlighted, making it easy to spot and review edits. The design follows an Apple-like style and uses `shadcn/ui` for UI consistency if necessary.

## Features

- **Side-by-Side Text Comparison**: Displays the original and proofread text in separate boxes.
- **Change Highlighting**: Highlights differences between the original and proofread text for easy review.
- **Simple and Clean UI**: Designed to be intuitive, with an Apple-like style.
